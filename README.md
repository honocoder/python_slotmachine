# Python Slot Machine

Little project to train with Python language.
The slot machine fully working in your shell : you can deposit money, choose how many lines you want to bet on, choose how much you want to bet on each line, see the results and your winnings.

Once you're enough rich, you can quit the slot machine and enjoy your money! (well, the part where you really win money is not developed for the moment... *work in progress... ðŸ‘€*)
